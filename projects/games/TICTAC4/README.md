Pretty polished game of [Ultimate tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe).

You can navigate both the big board and small boards with the arrow or number buttons. The big board shows previews for unfinished games, won games, and the board the player is forced to play on.

It also supports saving and restoring games for later.
