A version of the dice game [Yahtzee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee), for up two ten players (any more than that will crash).

Use the left and right arrows to select dice, then press dot to lock or unlock dice for the next roll. Press CLEAR to roll again, up to two times. Select a category to allot your points for that roll, but remember you can only use each category once!
