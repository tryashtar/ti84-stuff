A [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) board where you can fill in numbers and validate a solution. My favorite part is that since the home screen only has 8 rows but Sudoku has 9, I added the special ability to go "below" the final row and preview those cells.

I originally wanted to generate puzzles as well, before I learned it's very challenging. At least you can fill in the starting numbers yourself, but nothing stops you from overwriting them later!
