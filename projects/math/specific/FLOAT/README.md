This program converts numbers to and from 32-bit [IEEE-754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) floating point representation.

If you input a normal number, its floating point representation will be displayed (conveniently in two rows). Conversely, if you input a 32-digit number, the decimal form will be displayed.

The source for this program was written in the browser, so it contains comments and non-canonical syntax.
