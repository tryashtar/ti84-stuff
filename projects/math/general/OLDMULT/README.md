An older, slower version of [HUGEMULT](../HUGEMULT). I recreated long multiplication utilizing a matrix, matching my intuition that the digits in each number needed to be paired off and multiplied, forming a grid. Of course, carried digits and identical places need to be eventually combined, and my realization that that could be done during the calculations instead of after lead to the eventual rewrite.
