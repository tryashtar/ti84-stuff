You provide a function in terms of X, and can input either one or two points. When you input one point, the program calculates the limit from both sides of the point, the instantaneous rate of change, and the equation of the tangent line. When you input two points, the program calculates the average rate of change, and the integral between them.

One additional option, "function info," was never implemented. Also, the program crashes when the provided point is undifferentiable, not because of a logic error but because of a syntax error.
